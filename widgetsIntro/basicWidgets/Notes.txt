Flutter Widget Notes

* new widgets = subclasses; either StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget
* widgets main job = implement build() function to describe widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets
   (ex. React's Components?)
* framework builds the widgets until reaches underlying RenderObject

Basic Widgets
* Text() = run styled texts
* Row, Column() = flexible layouts for horizontal/vertical directions
   (ex. flexbox layout)
* Stack() = place widgets on top of each other; use Positioned() to position children of Stack relative to top, right, bottom or left edge of stack
   (ex. Absolute Positioning)
* Container = create rectangular visual element; use BoxDecoration() to decorate bg, border, shadow; had margins, padding and constraints, can be transformed in 3D w/ Matrix
